## 👋🏽 Hi, I'm Zain Bharde

I'm a **senior at Texas A&M University** studying **Data Engineering** with a **Computer Science minor**, currently based in **Houston, TX**. I enjoy building and shipping applications for real users, especially applications that sit at the intersection of **performance, data, and AI**.

I started programming in high school and never looked back. I currently have the most fun experimenting with **AI agents, modern full-stack tools, and production-scale workflows**. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me playing basketball, traveling to a new city, or trying a new resturant.

### 💼 Experience

I’ve interned as a **Software Engineer** at **Dematic** and **The Home Depot**, working on performance-critical backend systems, cloud infrastructure, and real-world production services.

On the side, I love building products end-to-end. My most recent project is **Umari**: a full-stack SaaS platform that helps small food vendors accept online orders through shareable links or QR codes, with real-time order management and payments.
